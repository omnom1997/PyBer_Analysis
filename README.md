# PyBer Analysis
## Overive
We were initially tasked to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We created bubble charts, box-and-whisker plots, and pie charts to show the trends of each bin based on city type as well as the summary statistics for each. Next, we were given a new assignment to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares by each city type.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
- This is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride sharing data include the total rides, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type



## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

raise fares just a little for people living in the city while lowering the cost of rides in rural areas
- would overall generate more profit bc urban riders use Pyber significantly more than rural riders. it could also possibly create more business in rural areas leading to even more profit if follow first
